This Project was a project From Kaggle( https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques), 
as a Team(Team_14_EDSA_2019) we were 
using advance regression techniques to predict the sales price of houses given features.
We used python  programming to solve this particular problem. 

In this Particualr task i was a lead programmer and we managed to get on 14% on the leaderboard.
